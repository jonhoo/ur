"""Extract raw PPG sessions from a decoded field log (0.8.13+, ur::heart=trace)
for host-tests/ppg's replay, with the Garmin's heart rate alongside.

Writes one line per segment (samples at one level, uninterrupted):

    <utc start> <garmin bpm or 0> <conversion period µs> <outcome> <sample> ... | <movement> ...

with the wrist's movement (`activity::movement`) as the firmware saw it at
each second's level check, so the replay can veto windows as it does, and
a third section with `asleep` if the sleep classifier said so when the
segment started (logs from before it, 0.8.x, never do), and `background`
if the schedule started the session, rather than someone looking at the
clock face (logs from before 0.9.0's `heart: due` line never say so).
The third section also has the LED's `drive=N` (0-3: 12.5-40 mA; logs
before 0.10's brighter phases have it from the level lines too), and
`brighter` for a segment that went on with a brighter LED after the one
before it ran out (see `heart_schedule::brighter`): the same session, its
flags carried over. A segment after a level change within a session
(a bright start stepping back down, say) carries them over too, marked
`cont`. Awake background sessions from 0.10's LED experiment (see
`heart_schedule::Arm`) say their arm, `arm=dim` or `arm=bright`, and
background sessions after 0.10.0-rc.3 their round of tries, `round=N`
(numbered from boot, wrapping at 65536), whose sessions share an arm.
Background sessions in a logging build after 0.10.0 say their length arm
too (see `heart_schedule::Length`), `length=longer` or `length=usual`: a
longer one on a busy wrist may run 90 s rather than 30, which its
segment's samples show; and a longer one that reads on a busy wrist
records on to 90 s (`heart: recording on`, then `heart: recorded to`),
its later readings logged as `record-only` but not counted, so its
segment holds all 90 s, its outcome the first reading. (The same logs'
`accel:` lines, the accelerometer's samples through each session, aren't
extracted here.)
