"""Screenshot the watch's screen over the debug probe, optionally after
injecting inputs (see src/debug.rs), which needs a build with the
`debug-input` feature (`cargo run --release --features debug-input`).

Reads the canvas's front buffer (what the panel shows: 80×80 colour roles)
and the current theme's palette from RAM with `esprobe fast-dump`, and
writes a PNG at the panel's 3× scale. The watch runs on as it's read, so a
frame drawn in the meantime can come out half old, half new: take another.

Usage:
    screenshot.py <elf> <out.png> [--input STEP ...] [--wait SECONDS] [--theme NAME]

Each STEP is applied in order, with --wait seconds after each (default 1.5,
enough for a transition): `button` (`button:2,0` presses twice, 0.2 s
apart), `tap:X,Y` (`tap:X,Y,MS` held for MS milliseconds, up to 255,
rather than 80), `long:X,Y`, or `up`, `down`, `left`, `right` (swipes,
optionally with `:X,Y`), in canvas pixels (0–79);
`glance` (as if the wrist turned) and `notify` (a test notification;
`notify` alone has a two-word name, big on two lines,
`notify:1,0` a four-word one, `notify:2,0` a much longer one,
`notify:3,0` and `notify:4,0` (with accents) two-word ones on two lines
in the medium face,
`notify:5,0` a short one, big, `notify:6,0` and `notify:7,0`
every ASCII symbol between them, `notify:8,0` curly quotes, a dash, and an
ellipsis; `notify:X,H` arrived H
hours ago, for the history's arrival times). `hang`, `panic` (a `defmt::panic!`) and `fault` (a
`core::panic!` as from a SoftDevice Controller fault, at "line" Y;
`fault:1,Y` with a long file name) crash the watch on
purpose, to test the crash reports. `battery:MV` makes the watch read its
battery as MV millivolts from then on (`battery:0` for the real reading
again), e.g. `battery:3300` to test what a critically low battery does: a
minute later the watch saves its activity and switches itself off.
`media:1,0` makes the phone seem to be playing something (`media` alone:
paused; `media:2,0` the track alone, with no word on whether it plays),
until it disconnects, for the music screen and the clock's media icon; it
only shows while the phone is connected.
`steps:N` counts N steps as walked now (up to 65535), to test what keeps
them across resets and updates.
`doubletap:X,Y` taps twice, 0.1 s apart, quicker than two `tap`s over
the probe can (for the button grid's double taps).
`bitmaps` sends a notification as Gadgetbridge does with its "Text as
Bitmaps" setting on (a word as an image), through the watch's parser.
`find` sends Gadgetbridge's "find my watch" line, through the watch's
parser, and `find:0,0` the one that stops it.
`press:X,Y` puts a simulated finger down at X,Y (or moves it there, if
it's down already), and `lift` lifts it: these go through the touch
task as the touch controller's reports would, so a long press is
recognised while the finger is held (e.g. `--input press:40,40 lift`
holds it for --wait seconds), and moving it (`press:40,40 press:40,70
lift --wait 0.3`) makes a swipe. `blip` (or `blip:MS`) has the touch
controller report that finger lifted, and back where it was 10 (or MS)
ms later, as it does mid-hold: within 30 ms, the same touch.
`asleep:1,0` makes the watch take the wearer as asleep from then on, as
if sleep tracking said so (the quiet night starts a second later), and
`asleep:0,0` leaves it to sleep tracking again (the night then ends as
on waking, or at once with `button:2,0`).

`--theme` renders the frame in another theme's colours (e.g. HANDHELD, for
the day look at night): the canvas holds colour roles, not colours.
