# Builds everything a release ships, the same way locally and in CI
# (`.github/workflows/`), reproducibly:
#
#   scripts/release.sh [--pre IDENTIFIER] [OUT]
#
# The version is Cargo.toml's, plus `-IDENTIFIER` if given (CI uses
# `pr.<number>` for pull requests and `snap.<commits>` for main), plus the
# commit as build metadata: `0.9.0+1a2b3c4`, `0.9.0-pr.12+1a2b3c4`. A tree
# with uncommitted changes adds `.dirty` to the commit. The firmware shows
# the whole version on its Info screen; see build.rs.
#
# OUT (default `dist`) receives, for each variant, named after the version
# without the commit:
#
# - `<variant>-<version>-dfu.zip`: the package to install or update over
#   Bluetooth (nRF Device Firmware Update app, `scripts/dfu.py`). This is
#   the file most people want.
# - `<variant>-<version>.img`: the raw MCUBoot image, for other tools.
# - `<variant>-<version>-slot.elf`: the image as an ELF, to flash a dev kit
#   over SWD (`esprobe flash`).
# - `<variant>-<version>.elf`: the linked firmware with symbols, which
#   decodes the watch's defmt logs (`defmt-print -e`).
#
# and `sha256.sum` over all of them. The variants:
#
# - `ur`: the normal build, logging at `info` to RTT (read only through a
#   debug probe).
# - `ur-logging`: keeps its log in the watch's SPI flash, for fetching over
#   Bluetooth (`scripts/fetch-log.py`) from a sealed watch, with the heart
#   rate's raw samples and the accelerometer's readings, for tuning. It
#   costs flash writes and a little battery.
# - `ur-<theme>`, for each theme (see src/themes/) other than the default:
#   `ur` with only that theme in it, for wearers who'd rather have that
#   look. One with colour schemes of one side only (night, say) shows them
#   by day and by night alike, and its FORCE can't change (README FAQ
#   D02); the release's notes say so. Only its `-dfu.zip`:
#   the other files are for dev kits and for decoding logs, and a wearer
#   who reports a problem can do so on `ur` or `ur-logging`. Its ELF is
#   held to every size constraint first (`scripts/size.py check`), as CI
#   holds the others.
#
# Both `ur` and `ur-logging` have the default themes (Cargo.toml's
# `default`).
#
# The same commit gives the same files, byte for byte, wherever it's built:
# rust-toolchain.toml pins the compiler, Cargo.lock (`--locked`) the
# dependencies, the paths of this checkout and of cargo's registry are
# replaced with fixed ones in the output, and `package.py` writes the zip
# without timestamps.
