//! The button grid: unlabelled buttons below the clock face, for Home
//! Assistant or the phone to act on, in one of two [`Layout`]s.
//!
//! **Six buttons**, one layer ([`Layout::Six`], the default): two rows of
//! three, numbered in reading order, each its own [`Press`], code 1–6.
//!
//! ```text
//!   1 2 3
//!   4 5 6
//! ```
//!
//! Each can be tapped, double-tapped, or held: 6 × 3 = 18 events. A
//! double tap is unambiguous here, as nothing else starts with a tap.
//!
//! **Two layers** ([`Layout::TwoLayers`]): nine buttons, a phone's
//! keypad, numbered in reading order:
//!
//! ```text
//!   1 2 3
//!   4 5 6
//!   7 8 9
//! ```
//!
//! A **single** button is one of the nine on its own; a **sequence** is
//! one tapped, then another (or the same one again). Each is a [`Press`],
//! with a code that reads as what was pressed: 1–9 for a single, and the
//! two digits for a sequence, 23 for 2 then 3: the first button the tens,
//! the second the ones. So codes run 1–99, and none ends in 0 (nor has a
//! 0 at all): 9 + 81 of them. On the last button:
//!
//! - **A single** can be tapped, or held. Not double-tapped: tapping 1
//!   twice is the sequence 1 then 1 (code 11).
//! - **A sequence** can be tapped (2, then 3), double-tapped (2, then 3
//!   twice), or held (2, then hold 3). So 1, 1, 1 is 11 double-tapped.
//!
//! That's 9 × 2 + 81 × 3 = 261 distinct events. What each does is up to
//! whoever receives them (see `crate::bthome` and `gb::Outgoing::Button`).
//!
//! A hold also says when it ends, in either layout: lifting the finger
//! sends a [`Gesture::Release`] with the same code (see [`Grid::lift`]),
//! for what should last as long as the finger stays down, like dimming a
//! light. And one held on, to [`LONG_HOLD`] from its start, is a long
//! press too: a [`Gesture::LongPress`] with the same code, sent then,
//! while the finger is still down (see [`Grid::expire`]), before the
//! release. A hold lifted sooner has none.
//!
//! Telling them apart takes waiting, since every tap might be the start of
//! something longer: [`Grid`] holds a tap until it can't be anything else.
//!
//! - With two layers, after a first tap, another touch that *starts* within
//!   [`WAIT_SECOND`] of its lift makes a sequence; otherwise it was a
//!   single tap, sent then. So single taps arrive that much late, which
//!   the grid shows (the button stays lit while it waits).
//! - After the tap that could be double-tapped (a sequence's second, or
//!   with six buttons, any first tap), a tap on the same button starting
//!   within [`WAIT_DOUBLE`] makes it a double tap; otherwise it was a
//!   tap, sent then.
//! - A hold needs no waiting: it's sent the moment it's recognised, while
//!   the finger is still down (see [`crate::gesture::LONG_PRESS`]). It can
//!   only be a single's, or end a sequence: nothing follows it.
//! - Anything that can't continue what's waiting (a touch that started
//!   too late, a tap on another button, or a hold, after a tap that only
//!   a double tap could continue) sends what was waiting as it stood, and
//!   starts afresh.
//! - A swipe, or the side button, cancels what's waiting: nothing is sent
//!   (see [`Grid::cancel`]). A hold's release is never cancelled: once
//!   its start went, something may be waiting for its end.
//!
//! The waits are measured from one touch's lift to the next one's start,
//! not between the moments each was recognised: a hold is only recognised
//! [`crate::gesture::LONG_PRESS`] after it starts, and a second button's
//! hold must still count as part of the sequence. So a wait can't run out
//! while a finger is down (see [`Grid::expire`]); the touch decides when
//! it ends.
//!
//! Hardware-free, so it runs in host tests (`host-tests/buttons`).
