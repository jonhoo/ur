//! Colour palettes.
//!
//! Screens never name concrete colours; they paint with *roles*
//! ([`Color::TEXT`], [`Color::ACCENT`], …), and the active [`Palette`] says
//! what each role looks like. The canvas stores role indices and only
//! resolves them to RGB when pushing pixels, so switching palette is a
//! matter of swapping it and repainting; nothing has to be re-rendered.
//!
//! Each theme's colour schemes have a palette, and one for the dim look
//! (see `crate::themes`), and the theme draws the screens with these
//! roles. Their names say what retro (`crate::themes::retro`), the first
//! theme, uses each for; another theme may give its 16 slots meanings of
//! its own.
//!
//! Pure data, with nothing of the firmware's but this: `host-tests/theme`
//! includes it, with retro's schemes, to check their colours.
