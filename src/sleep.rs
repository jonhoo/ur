//! Sleep, from wrist movement: which minutes were spent asleep, restless,
//! awake, or with the watch off the wrist.
//!
//! This is actigraphy, the method of research sleep watches: during sleep
//! the wrist is still, apart from brief stirs. The rules, applied to each
//! minute's movement (from [`crate::activity`]) and to whether the heart
//! rate sensor last saw skin:
//!
//! - **Falling asleep** is [`ONSET`] minutes of stillness, give or take
//!   stirs of up to [`STIR`] minutes; the sleep is dated from the start of
//!   the stillness, not the moment it qualified.
//!   Within a night (after a wake of up to [`SAME_NIGHT_GAP`] minutes),
//!   [`RESUME`] minutes are enough.
//! - **Waking** is [`WAKE_RUN`] minutes of movement, or walking (at least
//!   [`WAKE_STEPS`] steps in a minute). It's dated from the first of them.
//! - Shorter movement within sleep is a stir: up to [`STIR`] minutes stay
//!   sleep, longer is **restless** (Gadgetbridge's "awake during sleep").
//! - **Not worn** is when the heart rate sensor's last look found no skin.
//!
//! Sleep comes out of this as [`Kind::Light`]; [`crate::stages`] then
//! relabels it light, deep, or REM from the heart rate and the stirs. (This
//! used to call the inside of long, nearly motionless stretches deep, the
//! usual stand-in from movement alone; against a Garmin it was right about
//! a fifth of deep sleep, and saw no REM.)
//!
//! Since sleep is recognised only after the fact, classification runs over
//! a trailing window ([`WINDOW`] minutes, plus [`CONTEXT`] before it) every
//! minute, revising its recent past. Minutes older than the window are
//! final, as far as sleep and waking go (their stage can still change for a
//! while: see [`crate::sleep_hold`]).
//!
//! The thresholds are first guesses in our movement units (Bangle.js'
//! 8192-per-g; ~25 lying on a desk, hundreds when handled), to be tuned from
//! field logs of real nights.
//!
//! [`Night`] builds on the classifier's verdict to decide when the quiet
//! night (no buzzing or lit screen for notifications) starts and ends.
//!
//! This module knows nothing about the hardware or the clock, so it can be
//! tested on a computer (see `host-tests/sleep`).

/// - **An alarm** ringing ([`Night::end`]): the morning has come. (Not
///   a timer: one ringing at night is no sign of morning.)
/// - **The wearer saying so**, with a double press of the button

///   [`QUIET_AWAKE`] for the watch to act as by day.
/// - **Being awake for longer than [`QUIET_AWAKE`]**: the morning came
///   without an alarm. Being awake per the classifier isn't enough by
///   itself: getting up and walking (to the bathroom, say) ends sleep at
///   once there, and the wearer is likely back in bed within minutes.
/// - **Local noon** ([`noon_between`]), a backstop for a classifier stuck
///   on "asleep" (e.g. a watch lying still off the wrist, before the heart
///   rate sensor has said so), so that quiet can't last all day. Noon,
///   because it's past any morning, and well before any night.
///
/// Starting needs `asleep` to *turn* true, not just be true: after an alarm
/// (or noon, or the button) ends the night with the wearer still asleep
/// (as the classifier sees it: lying still, reading, after the button),
/// it stays over until they've been awake and then fallen asleep again.
/// Otherwise the alarm would end the night only for it to start again the
/// next minute.
///
/// Using the watch in the night (reading it, holding a grid button) is
/// awake only through the movement it takes, as the classifier sees it:
/// nothing here hears of touches. A minute or two of it is a stir at
/// most. [`WAKE_RUN`] minutes of fidgeting with it are waking, which
/// starts the [`QUIET_AWAKE`] count; settling then, [`RESUME`] still
/// minutes are asleep again, well within it, and the night goes on. Only
/// moving the wrist for about `WAKE_RUN + QUIET_AWAKE - RESUME` (18)
/// minutes without settling ends it, as being up would. A wrist held
/// still while reading counts as still, and so as asleep.
///
/// A **nap** is quiet too, but ends sooner: sleep that starts in the
/// daytime ([`nap_hours`]) ends after [`NAP_AWAKE`] minutes awake, not
/// [`QUIET_AWAKE`]. Waking from a nap is waking up, not a trip to the
/// bathroom; and noon, which ends any night, would cut a nap short anyway.
///
/// So does a **doze** after getting up: once an alarm has rung, or the
/// wearer has ended the night with the button, before noon ([`morning`]),
/// falling asleep again before noon is quiet as ever (the night resumes,
/// muted and dim, and the alarm, done for the day, doesn't ring again),
/// but ends after [`NAP_AWAKE`] minutes awake. The alarm or the wearer
/// said the morning had come, so waking from the doze is getting up, not
/// a trip to the bathroom. (In the field, the morning after a doze stayed
/// muted for [`QUIET_AWAKE`] minutes more after getting up.) Until noon,
/// as by then any night is over, and after it, sleep is a nap or the next
/// night, which keeps its own limit. Only in the morning: an alarm that
/// rings in the afternoon or evening (the night started after noon) is the
/// end of a nap, or of a night barely begun, and the night that follows is
/// a whole one. Every morning alarm counts, whether or not it ended a

/// awake) still says it's morning. Not being awake for [`QUIET_AWAKE`],
/// though: before dawn, that's as likely a long night-time wake as getting
/// up, and the sleep after it the rest of the night.
///
