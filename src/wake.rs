//! What a touch does while the screen is off (or glancing): wake it,
//! control the phone's media, or nothing.
//!
//! A touch on a dark screen is as likely a sleeve, a pocket, or bedding as
//! a finger, so most do nothing. What does something:
//!
//! - A deliberate tap (see [`deliberate`]) wakes the screen: at once with
//!   the screen off; on a glance, at once only if heavy, and otherwise
//!   once no second touch can follow it (see below).
//! - A second tap too slow for a double tap's (see below), but within
//!   [`RETRY_TAP_MS`] of the first, wakes it too, however light, and does
//!   nothing else: a retry, the wearer tapping again as the first did
//!   nothing they could see (see [`after`]). Without a phone, a double
//!   tap wakes it as well.
//! - While a phone is connected, two touches play, pause, or skip, without
//!   waking it: a double tap plays or pauses, and a tap, then a touch held
//!   (a tap-and-hold), skips to the next track (see [`second`], and
//!   [`after`] for how soon the second must start). The touch task
//!   reports the hold while the finger is still down, once it's been still
//!   for long enough, and the buzz then tells the wearer it took (see
//!   [`crate::gesture`]).
//!
//! The media gestures work the same whether the screen is off or glancing,
//! and on the clock face a tap from either woke (see below): the wearer can
//! pause or skip without looking. They need only a connected phone, not
//! word from it of what plays: Gadgetbridge only says when that changes,
//! so after the watch restarts there may be none for a long while, and its
//! commands act on the phone's player regardless. The awake clock face
//! has the same gestures, so the wearer needn't know whether the screen
//! is on to use them, with looser guards (see `crate::ui`, and
//! [`awake_long_press`]): something woke the screen to get there.
//!
//! With the screen off, a deliberate tap wakes it at once, so for a media
//! gesture to leave it off, its first tap must be light (under
//! [`DELIBERATE_TAP_MS`]). If it isn't, the second touch still counts, on
//! the clock face the first woke to: the same gesture does the same,
//! however firm its first tap.
//! The sealed watch's field log (0.9.0-m3.1) has the wearer's double taps
//! from off with their first tap held 47–67 ms, so all of them woke the
//! screen; 0.9.0's milestones tried waiting 300 ms after a deliberate tap
//! for a second before waking, but the wearer would rather have a single
//! tap's wake prompt, and tap lighter to stay in the dark.
//!
//! On a glance (see [`glance`]), where the screen is already lit and the
//! wearer looking, a tap's pair plays, pauses, or skips, leaving the
//! glance be, unless its first tap is heavy (held [`GLANCE_WAKE_TAP_MS`]
//! or more): that wakes the screen properly at once, as a deliberate tap
//! does from off. A deliberate tap short of that waits
//! ([`Action::WakeLater`]): if a second touch follows, the pair plays,
//! pauses, or skips, as after a light first tap; if none does, the
//! screen wakes then (see [`wake_later_due`]), [`DOUBLE_TAP_MS`] after
//! the tap. It used to wake the screen at once, as from off, but then a
//! media gesture on a glance woke the screen whenever its first tap was
//! firm, which to the wearer looked arbitrary: in 0.10.1-rc.1's field
//! log, their media first taps on a glance were 36–76 ms, and those of
//! 47 ms or more woke it. Nor can the duration alone tell the two apart:
//! the taps that woke a glance in older field logs, before the media
//! gestures, were mostly 47–67 ms too. So the wearer chose where heavy
//! starts, 75 ms, and a lighter tap that woke a glance still does, a
//! moment later; the wait costs little there, as the glance already
//! shows the time. (It used to be half a second, as long as a pair's
//! second then had: in 0.11.0's field log, the wearer tapped a glance
//! again 0.62 s after such a tap, just after it woke the screen, having
//! seen nothing happen.)
//!
//! How soon the second tap starts tells a double tap from a retry. A
//! double tap is quick: in the field logs (180 hours of them), the
//! wearer's, from off, on a glance, and on the clock face, started
//! their second tap 16–185 ms after the first lifted, and their
//! tap-and-holds' holds 0–78 ms after. Where a first tap left the screen
//! dark, or a glance waiting to wake (see above), and the wearer tapped
//! again, the second came 566–1277 ms after it; no pair at all started
//! its second between 185 and 566 ms. So a pair's
//! second touch must start within [`DOUBLE_TAP_MS`], 300 ms, of the
//! first's lift, and a tap later than that, up to [`RETRY_TAP_MS`],
//! 1.5 s, is a retry, which wakes the screen. A second tap used to need
//! only be reported within half a second of the first's (so start up to
//! ~450 ms after its lift) to play or pause, retry or not, and one later
//! did nothing unless deliberate on its own: most of those retries were,
//! held 47–76 ms, but some were as light as the first (28–37 ms).
//!
//! Guards against brushes, from the field logs (see [`deliberate`]):
//!
//! - Nothing happens on one touch alone, bar a deliberate tap's wake (a
//!   retry is the second of two light ones; see [`after`]). A
//!   long press with the screen off or on a glance used to play or pause,
//!   and an arm folded over the watch, resting against it, kept doing so
//!   (see [`centred`]); now it takes a tap first, which a resting arm
//!   rarely makes just before.
//! - Every touch that does something here must start away from the
//!   screen's edge ([`TAP_MARGIN`]): brushes, and the bedding's phantom
//!   long presses (two of nearly 10 s, one night, both at the top edge),
//!   start there. That goes for both touches of a pair: three phantom
//!   pairs in a night's log each had a tap at the edge, and so did a
//!   folded arm's tap-and-holds (see [`glance`]). On a glance, a tap at
//!   the edge still wakes the screen, if deliberate, but can't be part
//!   of a media gesture.
//! - The hold of a tap-and-hold must start in the middle of the screen,
//!   further from the edges than a tap need be ([`centred`]), as the long
//!   press that played or paused before it had to: a folded arm's long
//!   presses landed up to 15 canvas pixels in from the top or bottom.
//! - A hold must stay put (the touch task's [`SWIPE_DISTANCE`]
//!   tolerance), or it's a swipe, which does nothing here.
//! - In the quiet night (see [`crate::sleep::Night`]), nothing: bedding
//!   and pillows press and tap all night, and the touch controller sleeps
//!   anyway.
//!
//! What still gets through: a pair of light taps the arm made 9–10 canvas
//! pixels from the bottom edge, 117 ms apart, which skipped with the
//! screen off in 0.10.0-rc.1's field log, would now play or pause. A
//! wider margin at the top and bottom for taps too would stop it, but
//! double taps that look like the wearer's have landed 14 from the top,
//! and 60 down.
//!
//! TODO: decide whether a double tap's taps need a wider margin at the
//! top and bottom (12, say), once a field log shows whether the folded
//! arm's double taps keep playing or pausing.
//!
//! Hardware-free, so it runs in host tests (`host-tests/wake`).
