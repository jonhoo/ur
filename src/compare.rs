//! What the UI loop does and renders with, for checking the simulator
//! (`sim/`) against a dev kit, frame for frame (`ur-sim --devkit`). Only in
//! builds with the `compare` feature.
//!
//! The simulator runs the same UI code, so given the same inputs at the
//! same instants, and the same readings to render with, it must draw the
//! same frames. What a dev kit has that the simulator can't know is
//! exported here, in [`UR_COMPARE`], for the simulator to read over the
//! debug probe, as `scripts/screenshot.py` reads the canvas:
//!
//! - [`Boot`]: the instant the UI started, and the settings it loaded from
//!   flash.
//! - [`Event`]s: everything that changes the UI's state (ticks, inputs,
//!   and what a pass tells the App besides: whether a phone is connected,
//!   a room sensor heard, it's daytime, and the charger has power; that
//!   its power arrived, a glance on it showed, and it became full), with
//!   the exact instants and readings the UI loop handed it. The simulator
//!   replays them in order. A ring: the reader must keep up.
//! - [`Pass`]: what the last frame was rendered with (`ui::Status`,
//!   with the room sensor's reading and the BTHome identity, and today's
//!   activity), and a seqlock around it, so a reader can tell a
//!   frame whose canvas it read whole.
//! - [`Push`]: what pushing that frame to the panel sent, and how long it
//!   took, against which the simulator checks its model of the panel's
//!   timing.
//! - [`Music`]: the text of the latest music info (artist and track),
//!   the one message whose content the simulator can't know in advance:
//!   a phone connected to the dev kit sends its own as it plays.
//!
//! Everything is `repr(C)` plain integers, so the simulator, which
//! includes this file too, reads the bytes straight into the same types.
//! It costs ~2.4 KB of RAM, so it isn't in releases.
