//! A minimal async driver for the PineTime's ST7789 240×240 LCD.
//!
//! We used `mipidsi` at first, but it is blocking-only and takes pixels as a
//! per-pixel iterator. That meant the CPU converted every pixel *and then*
//! sat idle while SPI sent it, and nothing else (touch, soon Bluetooth) could
//! run during a ~115 ms full-screen push. This driver instead takes ready-made
//! byte slices and sends them with async DMA, so the caller can build each
//! line once and send it repeatedly (our 3× vertical scaling), and the
//! executor keeps running other tasks while bytes go out.
//!
//! Only what the UI needs is implemented: init, sleep/wake, idle mode, and
//! writing a rectangle of pixels.
//!
//! The panel draws ~6 mA while awake (datasheet, at its defaults), as much
//! as the backlight at its usual level, so it's set up to draw less, as
//! InfiniTime does (on every panel revision PINE64 has shipped, including
//! the ST7789P3 of 2026):
//!
//! - **Lower supply voltages** at init: the lowest AVDD/AVCL/VDDS
//!   (PWCTRL1), gate voltages (GCTRL), and booster clocks (PWCTRL2).
//!   InfiniTime's VDV (VDVS) too, which also evens out the step from black
//!   to the darkest greys.
//! - **Idle mode** for the dim white-on-black look ([`Display::set_idle`]):
//!   8 colours, refreshed at ~8 Hz instead of 60.
//!
//! The SPI bus is shared with the SPI flash (see [`crate::spi`]), so the
//! driver locks it per command, and for the whole of each rectangle of pixels
//! (from [`Display::start_pixels`] to [`Display::end_pixels`]). Flash
//! operations interleave between rectangles.
