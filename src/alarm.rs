//! Alarms: when they ring. (The UI sets them and shows them ringing; this
//! module only decides.)
//!
//! Three kinds:
//!
//! - **Smart wake**: "wake me before 07:00, when my sleep allows". Separate
//!   times for weekdays and weekends, and one switch for both (off for a
//!   holiday). In the [`SMART_WINDOW`] before the time it rings at a stir
//!   in light sleep (see [Smart wake](#smart-wake)). At the time itself it
//!   rings regardless, or as soon as the watch can if it couldn't check
//!   then (see [`CATCH_UP`]).
//! - **Alarms**: two, each at a time of day, the next time it comes round.
//!   Each turns itself off after ringing.
//! - **Phone alarms**: up to [`PHONE_ALARMS`], set in Gadgetbridge and
//!   synced to the watch (see [`Phone`]). Each rings at a time of day, on
//!   the weekdays it repeats on, or once (then turning itself off).
//! - **Timers**: two, each ringing after a duration. Each remembers its last
//!   duration, as that's usually the one wanted again (the tea, the
//!   laundry).
//!
//! Times are local, so they follow the phone's time zone. Everything is
//! computed in "local seconds since 1970" (UTC plus the UTC offset), which
//! makes "the next 07:00" plain arithmetic; times of day are minutes after
//! midnight.
//!
//! Durations (timers and the snooze) are different: ten minutes is ten
//! minutes whatever the clock says, so they count in seconds of uptime,
//! which only ever go forward. The phone setting the clock (or a new time
//! zone) moves when 07:00 is, but not when the tea is ready. (Uptime
//! starts again at a reset, but so does this module's state: nothing
//! armed survives one.)
//!
//! Like [`crate::sleep`], this knows nothing of hardware or the clock, so it
//! runs in host tests (`host-tests/alarm`).
//!
//! # Smart wake
//!
//! The wearer would rather be woken from light sleep than from REM, and
//! from REM rather than from deep sleep, which leaves you groggy. So in
//! its window, the smart alarm rings at a stir (the wrist moving now,
//! [`Wearer::stirring`]) only once the ten minutes before it were light
//! sleep ([`Wearer::light`], `crate::stages::light`): none of
//! them staged deep or REM, as staged so far, and not all of them still.
//! A wearer awake in bed counts as light: there's nothing to spare them.
//!
//! It used to ring at the first stir in the window, from whatever sleep.
//! But asleep, the wrist stirs about once a minute, so it rang within a
//! few minutes of the window opening, from light, REM, and deep sleep
//! alike. On four mornings in a row (2026-11-08 to 11-11) it rang 0.3 to
//! 2.6 minutes into its window: from what a Garmin worn alongside called
//! REM sleep, deep sleep (a stir out of 20 still minutes), REM, and
//! light sleep. This rule would have rung at the last of those only.
//!
//! The rule comes from replaying the watch's field logs from those four
//! nights (every poll's movement and every heart rate reading, through
//! the firmware's own classifier and stages, minute by minute as the
//! watch ran them; `host-tests/alarm` does that) against the Garmin's
//! stages, for wake times every 2 minutes from 05:00 to when the wearer
//! actually woke (440 windows):
//!
//! | rings at a stir…          | light | REM | deep | awake | at its time | minutes in |
//! |---------------------------|-------|-----|------|-------|-------------|------------|
//! | anywhere (the old rule)   | 50%   | 37% | 11%  | 1%    | 0%          | 4          |
//! | after 10 minutes of light | 64%   | 25% | 6%   | 5%    | 26%         | 16         |
//! | never (a plain alarm)     | 48%   | 36% | 14%  | 2%    | 100%        | 30         |
//!
//! Of the rings before the time, the old rule's were 11% from deep sleep
//! (48 of 438) and 37% from REM; this rule's are none or one of about 325
//! from deep sleep and 21% from REM. The deep sleep left is that of
//! alarms that come at their time, as a plain alarm's would. (For wake
//! times from 06:30 only, nearer the real ones, the old rule rang 55% in
//! light sleep and 4% in deep, this one 71% and none, 11% at its time.)
//!
//! Each half of the rule does its own part. Deep sleep is still, and the
//! live stages hardly ever say deep after the fifth hour of sleep
//! (`crate::stages::DEEP_UNTIL`), when alarms ring: the stir before rules
//! it out. Alone, though, a stir after another let 4% of rings come from
//! deep sleep, and 43% from REM. Leaving out what the live stages call
//! REM (the Garmin's REM, too, in 86% of those minutes on these nights)
//! takes away about a third of the REM wake-ups; alone, it let 5% come
//! from deep sleep. Five minutes of light sleep instead of ten, or
//! fifteen for the stir, did worse on one or the other.
//!
//! Two more ideas didn't pay. Letting a stir in REM ring in the window's
//! last 10 minutes (REM being better than deep sleep, which the time may
//! fall in) took the rings from deep sleep only from 6% to 5%, and those
//! from REM up from 25% to 30% (in the last 5: 6% and 27%). The alarm
//! meets deep sleep at its time when the wearer lies still to the end,
//! with no stir to ring at sooner. And denser heart rate in the window
//! (a Garmin's, every 2 minutes, standing in for the watch's) told REM
//! from light sleep no better than the same readings every 6 minutes.
//! Holding the alarm back while the watch's own heart rate stood above
//! the hour's baseline left the share of REM wake-ups as it was, and rang
//! early less often.
//!
//! Four nights are few, of one wearer, and the Garmin's stages are only
//! its estimate; the windows overlap (a stir rings many of them), so
//! they're not 440 separate tests. The deep part rests on what sleep is
//! like as much as on the counts; the REM part on the live REM being
//! right, as it was on these nights. The cost is plain: about a quarter
//! of the time no light sleep comes in time, and the alarm rings at its
//! time, from whatever sleep, as a plain alarm would.
