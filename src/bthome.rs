//! The button grid's presses as BTHome v2 advertisements, for Home
//! Assistant's BTHome integration (see docs/buttons.md for setting it up,
//! and docs/bthome-design.md for the reasoning).
//!
//! BTHome is one-way: the watch advertises service data under UUID
//! 0xFCD2, and Home Assistant, listening through any of its Bluetooth
//! adapters or proxies, decodes it. No pairing, no phone.
//!
//! **What a press looks like.** Home Assistant fires *events* (rather
//! than updating a sensor's state, which a second identical press
//! wouldn't change) for BTHome's button (`0x3A`: press, double press,
//! hold, release, … and nothing more) and dimmer (`0x3C`: rotate left or
//! right, by a number of steps) objects. It tells repeated objects apart
//! only by their position in the advertisement (`button_1`, `button_2`,
//! …), and an encrypted legacy advertisement has room for 15 bytes of
//! objects: the packet id (`00`, which Home Assistant uses to drop the
//! repeats of one press), and six two-byte objects. Every advertisement
//! of a layout has the same objects, in the same order, so their
//! positions, and with them Home Assistant's names, never change. What
//! goes in them depends on the grid's [`Layout`] (see docs/bthome-design.md
//! for the budget, and why not extended advertising):
//!
//! **Six buttons:** six button objects, one per button, in order, so Home
//! Assistant names them `button_1` to `button_6`. The pressed one's says
//! what it did: `press` (`01`), `double_press` (`02`), `hold_press`
//! (`80`), `long_press` (`04`, the same hold, held on), or `hold_release`
//! (`81`, on the lift after a hold); the rest
//! say "none" (`00`), which fires nothing. Each button and gesture is a
//! device trigger in Home Assistant's UI. 14 bytes: no room for the
//! battery (two more), which goes in an advertisement of its own instead,
//! the packet id and the battery alone, which fires no event: soon after
//! boot (or turning six buttons for Home Assistant on), then as it moves
//! by a 5% step (see [`battery_due`]).
//!
//! **Two layers** (codes 1–99, none ending in 0): the buttons can't each
//! have an object (nine, let alone a code each), so each advertisement
//! says what happened twice over, for two kinds of automation:
//!
//! | Object     | Home Assistant's event class | Fires                         |
//! |------------|------------------------------|-------------------------------|
//! | `3A ..`    | `button`                     | the gesture, as BTHome names it |
//! | `3C ...`   | `dimmer_1`                   | a tap, turning right by the code |
//! | `3C ...`   | `dimmer_2`                   | a double tap, by the code     |
//! | `3C ...`   | `dimmer_3`                   | a hold right, a long press left, by the code |
//!
//! The button is the gesture alone, as above. The dimmers carry which
//! code it was: the one for the gesture turns right (`02`) by the code
//! (`23` for 2 then 3), so a single event says both, and one trigger can
//! match it. A long press (the same hold, held on) turns the hold's
//! dimmer the other way, left (`01`), by the code: there's no room for a
//! fourth dimmer, and it's a hold's, so a hold's dimmer says both, by
//! direction. An automation must then match the direction (Home
//! Assistant's `event_type`, `rotate_right` or `rotate_left`) as well as
//! the code, or a hold fires it twice; the docs' examples all do. A
//! release turns no dimmer: only one hold can be down at a time, so its
//! end needs no code. The dimmers that don't turn carry `00 00`, which
//! fires nothing. With the packet id, and the battery
//! (`01`, a battery sensor that updates with each press), that's 15
//! bytes, all there's room for.
//!
//! **Encrypted**, with AES-CCM and a key made on the watch at first boot
//! (shown from the button grid's settings, for typing into Home
//! Assistant). Home Assistant then ignores anything from the watch's
//! address it can't decrypt, and drops replays of a press, and stale
//! copies of one (which Bluetooth stacks re-report from their caches)
//! rather than firing again.
//! The counter in the nonce never repeats: it's reserved in flash ahead of
//! use (see `device::send`).
//!
//! The encoding and encryption are hardware-free, and run in host tests
//! (`host-tests/bthome`, against BTHome's published test vector) and the
//! simulator, which prints what the watch would send. `device` keeps the
//! key and counter, and hands each advertisement to [`crate::ble`].
