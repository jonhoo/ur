//! Themes: how every screen looks, and where its buttons are.
//!
//! A theme is a type that draws every screen and says where a touch on
//! it lands ([`Theme`], with no default methods). Its colour schemes,
//! what the settings' THEME row picks between, are statics of that type:
//! retro ([`retro`], the watch's own look) is one type, and ARCADE,
//! TERMINAL, HANDHELD and PARCHMENT are its schemes, each with a palette
//! of its own. A theme with one look has one scheme (or one a side). The
//! only things a scheme must have are a palette and a dim one (see
//! [`Theme::palette`]): what the 16 colour roles mean, and how a scheme
//! differs from another, is the theme's business.
//!
//! Each theme lives in a directory of its own, `src/themes/<name>/`: its
//! code, a README with screenshots, and the simulator script that takes
//! them (`shots.txt`, into `shots/`). See AUTHORING-THEMES.md for adding
//! a theme.
//!
//! Each theme is a Cargo feature, `theme-<name>` (`theme-retro` the
//! default; `themes-all`, every one), so a build has only the themes it
//! names: the rest aren't compiled, which keeps the image small. The UI
//! holds a scheme as a [`Scheme`], an enum with a variant a built-in
//! theme, and calls the theme through a `match` on it, rather than a
//! `dyn Theme`: with one theme built in (the default, and every theme's
//! own package) that's a direct call, which inlines into the UI's
//! rendering as if there were no themes at all.
//!
//! A scheme is for darkness or for daylight: each theme lists its
//! schemes by side ([`BuiltIn`]), and may have either side, or both, and
//! several a side. The UI uses the night schemes from sunset, the day
//! ones from sunrise, and the settings' THEME row steps through the side in
//! use: every built-in theme's schemes for it, in [`THEMES`]' order. A
//! build with no scheme for a side (only night themes, say) uses the
//! other side's then.
//!
//! Every theme draws the dim look too (a glance, a notification on a dark
//! screen, the quiet night), in its scheme's [`Theme::dim`] palette,
//! which the canvas swaps in: the same drawing, other colours. A theme
//! may also draw differently there (retro's clock face does).

///
/// No default methods: a new theme says how it draws each screen, and
/// where its buttons are, rather than inheriting another theme's without
/// anyone noticing. A theme draws every screen with its own code, never
/// another theme's: it may use [`helpers`] (mechanics that choose no
/// colour, place, size or font) and the shared crate modules (the canvas,
/// fonts, palettes, and the data a screen shows), but no other theme's
/// module. One that starts from another's look starts from a copy of its
/// code (see AUTHORING-THEMES.md), and the build refuses a theme feature
/// that turns on another (see `manifests.rs`).
