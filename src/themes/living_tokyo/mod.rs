//! Living Tokyo: a city at night on the clock face (see [`clock`]), in
//! Tokyo Night's colours: LIVING TOKYO and LIVING STORM, both for the
//! night, as the city is the night's (see [`schemes`]), and the black,
//! white and red dim look ([`GLANCE`]).
//!
//! The clock face is the city seen from afar; the other screens are
//! being restyled as the same city at street level, each living on the
//! time and on what it shows, from the shared pieces in [`street`] (see
//! DESIGN.md beside this file for the language and the plan). Restyled so
//! far: the glances (the time's, its timers', the route's and the
//! charge's) and the full charge, Today, Last night, a notification and
//! its banner, and an alarm ringing. Every other screen, and where its taps land, started as a
//! copy of Retro's (`scripts/new-theme.sh`): the files beside this one,
//! a file a group of screens, in Living Tokyo's colours, its own code
//! from here on. [`LivingTokyo`]'s [`Theme`] says which draws which.
//!
//! TODO: the rest of the screens in the city's style (DESIGN.md's plan).

// Its own code is held to dead code in every build, even one where the
// shared code a theme draws with isn't (see `main.rs`), so that a copy
// of it, built alone, still says what it no longer uses.
