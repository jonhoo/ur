# Living Tokyo

[Try it live](https://jonhoo.github.io/ur/sim/?theme=living_tokyo): the simulator, in your browser.

A city at night on the clock face, in [Tokyo Night]'s colours: the time
and its seconds across the top, the moon as the battery, windows lit by
the day's steps, a beacon blinking and a sign showing the heart rate
(OFF, unlit, on the charger, where it isn't measured), and a billboard
for notifications nobody has seen. It's drawn once a
second and stays still in the dim look. No weather.
(`theme-living_tokyo`.)

Every other screen is, for now, a copy of [Retro](../retro/)'s, in
Tokyo Night's colours, to be restyled in the city's look; bar the glance
on the charger, which shows the clock face's moon, big, and the full
charge's screen: the city under a full moon, struck by lightning, with
FULL in neon.

## Colour schemes

Two, both for the night: LIVING TOKYO and LIVING STORM, Tokyo Night's
Night and Storm. The dim look (a glance, a notification on a dark
screen, the quiet night) is white and red on black in both.

| LIVING TOKYO | LIVING STORM |
|---|---|
| <img src="shots/clock-living-tokyo.png" width="120" alt="The clock face in LIVING TOKYO: blue-white on near-black indigo, the windows yellow, cyan and magenta"> | <img src="shots/clock-living-storm.png" width="120" alt="The clock face in LIVING STORM: the same, on a lighter, bluer slate"> |

It has no schemes for the day: it's a city at night. Tokyo Night's Day
is one of Retro's schemes instead, TOKYO DAY, beside Retro's TOKYO NIGHT
and TOKYO STORM: Retro's screens in the same colours.

## By day

Its package, `ur-living_tokyo-<version>-dfu.zip`, has Living Tokyo
alone, so it shows the city by day too. FORCE, on the settings' LOOK,
can't change there, as there's no day scheme to force: a tap on it says
so with FAQ D02.

For Tokyo Night's Day by day, build it beside Retro: THEME then steps
through Retro's day schemes, TOKYO DAY among them, from sunrise, and
through both themes' night schemes from sunset.

```sh
cargo build --release --no-default-features --features theme-retro,theme-living_tokyo
```

(Then package it as [AUTHORING-THEMES.md](../../../AUTHORING-THEMES.md#on-a-watch)
says.)

## Last night and LOOK

| Screen | At night (LIVING TOKYO) |
|---|---|
| Last night | <img src="shots/night-last-night.png" width="120" alt="Last night, at night, in LIVING TOKYO"> |
| LOOK, in Settings | <img src="shots/night-look-settings.png" width="120" alt="LOOK's settings, at night, in LIVING TOKYO"> |

## On the charger

Woken there, the screen shows the glance on the charger in Tokyo
Night's colours; a press or a touch goes on to the clock face. Once the
charge is done, the full charge's screen takes over for a few seconds,
with a buzz.

| Woken on the charger (LIVING TOKYO) | The clock face there | Full |
|---|---|---|
| <img src="shots/charging.png" width="120" alt="Woken on the charger: the time at the top in pale lavender; the moon, big, waxing in green among faint stars, with 66% under it; then FULL IN, and 1:12, big, on the night blue"> | <img src="shots/clock-charging.png" width="120" alt="The clock face on the charger: the moon waxing, in green; the beacon dark; and the heart rate's sign reading OFF, unlit"> | <img src="shots/charged.png" width="120" alt="Fully charged: the city at night under a big full moon, lightning in yellow and white striking a distant roof, and FULL in magenta neon on a dark sign in front of the buildings"> |

## The dim look

| A glance | A notification, with the screen off | A glance on the charger |
|---|---|---|
| <img src="shots/dim-glance.png" width="120" alt="A glance: the hours above the minutes, big, white on black"> | <img src="shots/dim-notification.png" width="120" alt="A notification that arrived with the screen off: the app in red, and who it's from, big, in white"> | <img src="shots/dim-charging.png" width="120" alt="On the charger: the time small in red; the moon, big, waxing to the charge, among red stars, with 66% under it; then FULL IN in red, and 1:12, big, in white"> |

These are `shots.txt`'s, drawn in a build with every theme (where
FORCE is a choice), which the simulator's tests check (see
[AUTHORING-THEMES.md](../../../AUTHORING-THEMES.md#the-readme-and-its-screenshots)).
Every other screen, and the clock face in the states it shows
(notifications unseen, a low battery, charging, a second's blink), is
`screens.txt`'s, which they only run, to check that each draws; to look
at them all, run it with `--out` (see its first lines).
