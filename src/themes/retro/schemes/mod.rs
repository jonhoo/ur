//! Retro's colour schemes: the [`Retro`] type, its schemes (statics of
//! it, each with a palette of its own), and which side of the day each is
//! for.
//!
//! Pure data, needing only `crate::palette`: `host-tests/theme` includes
//! this file, with the modules beside it, to check the schemes' colours.
//! The drawing is `super`'s.
//!
//! A new scheme is a static of [`Retro`] here, or, for a set of them, in
//! a module of its own beside this file (`tokyo_night.rs`, `mod
//! tokyo_night;` here), listed in [`NIGHT`] or [`DAY`] after the four
//! below: nothing else to change, and no feature, as every one of
//! Retro's schemes is part of `theme-retro`. Its name is what the settings'
//! THEME row shows, on its own, and its ID in flash
//! ([`crate::palette::id`]), so a name says which it is ("TOKYO NIGHT",
//! not "NIGHT"), and is for good. See AUTHORING-THEMES.md.

/// notification's app and time, the clock's seconds and colon, the step
/// blocks. That's the one step of hierarchy the dark schemes get from
/// their greys and their accent. The heart and a low battery are red, as
/// in the other schemes; shadows black.

/// with black, the panel's columns alternately lit (see
/// [`Palette::columns`]), as idle mode has no grey of its own. Light sleep
