# Retro

[Try it live](https://jonhoo.github.io/ur/sim/?theme=retro): the simulator, in your browser.

The watch's own look, after old handhelds, arcade cabinets, terminals
and printed game manuals: pixel art on the 80×80 canvas, big 5×7 digits
with a drop shadow, few colours a scheme, ramps of a single hue, and
dithering for the shades between. The default theme (`theme-retro`).

## Colour schemes

Retro's own, ARCADE and TERMINAL for the night, and HANDHELD and
PARCHMENT for the day, then any others below; the dim look (a glance, a
notification on a dark screen, the quiet night) is white and red on
black in every one.

### Tokyo Night

TOKYO NIGHT and TOKYO STORM for the night, and TOKYO DAY for the day:
Retro's screens in the colours of [Tokyo Night], the Neovim theme. The
accent is its blue, labels its fg_dark, the heart's highlight its
yellow, and deep and REM sleep its cyan and magenta.

| TOKYO NIGHT | TOKYO STORM | TOKYO DAY |

## Last night and LOOK

| Screen | At night (ARCADE) | By day (HANDHELD) |
|---|---|---|
| Last night | <img src="shots/night-last-night.png" width="120" alt="Last night, at night, in ARCADE"> | <img src="shots/day-last-night.png" width="120" alt="Last night, by day, in HANDHELD"> |

## On the charger

Woken there, the screen shows the glance on the charger in the scheme's
colours; a press or a touch goes on to the clock face. No heart rate is
measured there: the heart goes grey, and says OFF. Once the charge is
done, the battery's bolt takes the screen for a few seconds, big, with
FULL, and a buzz.

| On the charger | At night (ARCADE) | By day (HANDHELD) |
|---|---|---|
| Woken there | <img src="shots/charging.png" width="120" alt="Woken on the charger, in ARCADE: the time at the top in grey; the battery, three times the clock face's, with its red bolt and 66%; then FULL IN, and 1:12, big, in white"> | <img src="shots/charging-handheld.png" width="120" alt="The same in HANDHELD: dark green ink on the pale green screen, the bolt in its red"> |
| The clock face | <img src="shots/clock-charging.png" width="120" alt="The clock face on the charger, in ARCADE: the battery charging, with its red bolt; the heart grey, with OFF in grey beside it"> | <img src="shots/clock-charging-handheld.png" width="120" alt="The same in HANDHELD: the heart in olive ink rather than its red, with OFF"> |
| Full | <img src="shots/charged.png" width="120" alt="Fully charged, in ARCADE: a big red lightning bolt with a drop shadow, and FULL under it in white"> | <img src="shots/charged-handheld.png" width="120" alt="The same in HANDHELD: the bolt in olive ink rather than red, FULL in its darkest green"> |

## The dim look

| A glance | A notification, with the screen off | A glance on the charger |
|---|---|---|
| <img src="shots/dim-glance.png" width="120" alt="A glance: the hours above the minutes, big, white on black"> | <img src="shots/dim-notification.png" width="120" alt="A notification that arrived with the screen off: the app in red, and who it's from, big, in white"> | <img src="shots/dim-charging.png" width="120" alt="On the charger: the time small in red; the battery, three times the clock face's, with its red bolt and 66%; then FULL IN in red, and 1:12, big, in white"> |

These are `shots.txt`'s, which the simulator's tests check (see
[AUTHORING-THEMES.md](../../../AUTHORING-THEMES.md#the-readme-and-its-screenshots)).
Every other screen is `screens.txt`'s, which they only run, to check
that each draws; to look at them all, run it with `--out` (see its first
lines).

The simulator's [tour](../../../sim/shots/tour/) has most of Retro's
screens too.

- Inspired by: no other theme. Its looks are those of old handhelds,
  arcade cabinets and terminals in general, not of any one watch face.
