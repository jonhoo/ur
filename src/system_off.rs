//! System OFF: the nRF52832's deepest sleep, where nothing runs and only a
//! pin (or a reset) wakes the chip, which then boots from scratch. The
//! watch goes there for two reasons ([`Reason`]):
//!
//! - **The battery is critically low** (see [`crate::battery`]): rather
//!   than run on until it browns out, losing the day's activity the phone
//!   hasn't fetched yet, the watch saves that and switches itself off.
//!   Plugging in the charger wakes it.
//! - **Storage mode**, chosen on the info screen (see [`crate::ui`]), for a
//!   watch put away for weeks: the same, but the button wakes it too.
//!
//! Switching off ([`shut_down`]) shows why for a few seconds, then, in the
//! dark:
//!
//! 1. The history the phone hasn't fetched, and today's steps, go into a
//!    record in the SPI flash (format in [`crate::snapshot`]), written by
//!    the activity task (see [`serve`]). The field log is written out too.
//! 2. Everything on the board that would keep drawing current is put to
//!    sleep: the heart-rate sensor (its LED, if a measurement was running),
//!    the accelerometer, the touch controller, the display, the SPI flash.
//! 3. The wake pins are armed, and the chip goes off.
//!
//! Waking is a reset: the bootloader runs, then ur boots as after any
//! reset, [`restore`]s the record into the history, and the phone fetches
//! it with the rest at its next sync, after which the record is retired
//! ([`on_synced`]), so it can't be restored twice. The clock doesn't run
//! while off, so the time is unknown until the phone sets it (see
//! [`crate::clock::forget`]).
//!
//! The same record carries the activity across a deliberate reset, such
//! as installing an update ([`save_before_reset`]): the history lives in
//! RAM that every reset loses, and today's steps in RAM that survives an
//! ordinary reset but not, it turns out, the bootloader swapping in an
//! update (a field log's update lost the day's 202 steps).
//!
//! What the watch draws while off, roughly (E: estimate, D: datasheet,
//! M: measured by others; nothing here is measured on this watch):
//!
//! | | µA | |
//! |---|---:|---|
//! | nRF52832 in System OFF, no RAM retention | 0.3 | D |
//! | Button powered, so it can wake the watch (storage mode only) | 34 | M (PINE64 wiki) |
//! | Display controller asleep | ~10 | E |
//! | Accelerometer suspended, touch controller in deep sleep | a few | E |
//! | SPI flash in deep power-down | 1 | D |
//! | Battery voltage divider | 2 | D |
//! | Regulator, charger, leakage | ~15 | E |
//!
//! So ~30 µA off a critically low battery, whose ~4 mAh then last days
//! before the cell's protector cuts it off, and ~65 µA in storage mode:
//! about 40% of a full charge over six weeks. The button costs half of
//! that, which is why a critically low battery doesn't keep it powered:
//! only the charger can help an empty watch, and the button would run it
//! down to the protector twice as fast.
//!
//! No RAM is kept while off. Retention would cost next to nothing (~25 nA
//! for the 4 KiB section holding `memory.x`'s retained block: Nordic gives
//! 0.3 µA without, 0.7 µA with all 64 KiB), but what that block holds is
//! no use after System OFF: the clock would be stale, today's steps are in
//! the record anyway, and a breadcrumb only matters after a crash.
