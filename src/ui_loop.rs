//! The UI loop's every pass: what it does when it wakes (a tick, an input,
//! a timer), what it saves, when it renders and with what, and when the
//! screen goes on and off. `main` runs it on the watch, and the simulator
//! (`sim/`) runs the very same code on a computer.
//!
//! What touches hardware goes through [`Board`]: the panel's power, the
//! backlight, the battery's and the die's sensors, the watchdog, the
//! button grid's advertisements, and switching off. `main` implements it
//! with the real thing; the simulator with stand-ins. Everything else (the
//! decisions) is here, once, so the two can't drift apart. What other
//! tasks share with the loop (the phone's connection, the room sensors heard,
//! today's activity, the heart rate) it reads from their modules, as on
//! the watch; the simulator includes or stands in for those.
//!
//! The loop itself is short, and `main`'s:
//!
//! ```text
//! let (mut app, mut ui) = UiLoop::boot(Stored::load().await);
//! loop {
//!     ui.pass(&mut app, &mut board, canvas).await;   // render, screen power
//!     let wake = /* the next tick, input, or timer */;
//!     ui.handle(&mut app, &mut board, wake).await;   // act on it, save
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The simulator runs the same three steps, but decides itself when the
//! next tick or timer is due ([`TICK`], [`timer_at`]), on a clock it
//! moves, rather than waiting for them.
