//! The field log: everything we'd see over the debug probe, kept in the SPI
//! flash, for watches without one (a sealed watch on a wrist).
//!
//! defmt already encodes every log message compactly into the RTT buffer
//! that a debug probe reads. In a field build (the `field-log` feature) this
//! module *is* that reader: it drains the buffer once a second and appends
//! the raw defmt frames to a ring of sectors in the SPI flash. A computer
//! later fetches them over Bluetooth (`scripts/fetch-log.py`, through the
//! service in [`crate::ble`]) and decodes them with `defmt-print` and the
//! ELF of the build that wrote them. So the field log costs no formatting
//! code on the watch, and holds what the probe would have shown, but for
//! its busiest lines, which a field build packs (see [`crate::log_pack`];
//! `scripts/expand_log.py` unpacks them after decoding).
//!
//! Not for builds read through a probe: the probe and this module would
//! each take whatever the other didn't.
//!
//! Layout: [`REGION`] is a ring of 4 KiB sectors, each a 16-byte header
//! (magic, sequence number, image version, data length) followed by whole
//! defmt frames. Every boot starts a new sector; the oldest is erased to
//! make room. The length is written when a sector is closed (NOR flash can
//! still clear bits of the erased header), so a sector without one is either
//! the current one or was cut off by a reset; the reader then trims at the
//! last frame boundary.
//!
//! Also here, because they're about knowing what happened in the field: the
//! reset reason, and where the previous run panicked (see [`panic`]).
