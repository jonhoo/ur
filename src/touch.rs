//! CST816S touch controller.
//!
//! The chip pulses its interrupt line (P0.28) when it has a new report.
//! Between touches it sleeps and **ignores I2C entirely** (we measured it
//! NACKing ~0.4 s after reset), so it's only ever read in response to an
//! interrupt, never polled, and must be configured right after reset while
//! it's still awake.
//!
//! The chip has its own gesture recognition, but in practice swipes were hard
//! to trigger with it, and its thresholds aren't adjustable. So we ask it for
//! raw reports throughout each touch and classify the touch ourselves from
//! where it started and ended, and how long it lasted.
//!
//! What each touch was is [`crate::gesture`]'s call. A long press is
//! the exception to waiting for the lift: it's reported the moment the
//! finger has been down for [`LONG_PRESS`] without moving, while it's
//! still down. The timer runs from the press, not from reports, though
//! the chip does keep reporting (every ~10 ms) for as long as a finger is
//! down, however still: the field logs have long presses of nearly 10 s,
//! which [`LIFT_TIMEOUT`] would otherwise have cut short.
//!
//! Nearly 10 s, and no longer, perhaps because the chip resets itself
//! after a long press of its `LongPressTime`, 10 s by default (per
//! Hynitron's register declaration), which ends the touch: reports stop,
//! and [`LIFT_TIMEOUT`] sends its release. So [`configure`] raises that
//! to [`HOLD_LIMIT`], for a grid hold's release to come at the lift.
//! That seems to take: on the dev kit (2026-11-10, a real finger), holds
//! of 13.3 s, 42 s and 54 s all kept the screen on and released at the
//! lift, none at 10 s.
//!
//! But the chip doesn't keep a long, still finger for ever on its own:
//! the 42 s and 54 s holds were meant to last ~70 s, and it reported a
//! lift with the finger still down, likely its baseline tracking taking
//! the finger in (a cold one, that day). And one 9.2 s hold "lifted",
//! then pressed again 20 ms later, with no lift the wearer remembers: a
//! second `hold_press` mid-hold. So [`HOLD_LIMIT`] wasn't reached there.
//! The sealed watch does it far more often, and quicker: one day's field
//! log (0.10.0-rc.6) has holds chopped into pieces of 67–552 ms, each
//! pressed again 7–12 ms after it lifted, exactly where it was; earlier
//! ones (0.9.0's pre-releases, 0.10.0-rc.1 and rc.2, before
//! `LongPressTime` was raised) have the same. So a press that soon after
//! a lift, on the same spot, continues the touch (see
//! [`crate::gesture::REJOIN_WINDOW`]), which every lift waits for before
//! it's reported. Each touch's line in the log says how many times it was
//! rejoined, if at all, and the first rejoined lift's report is logged as
//! it happens, to see what the chip says then.
//! TODO: find what drops the finger (`AutoReset`, 0xFB? the baseline's
//! update rate?).
//!
//! [`LONG_PRESS`]: crate::gesture::LONG_PRESS
//! [`HOLD_LIMIT`]: crate::gesture::HOLD_LIMIT
//!
//! When touches can't do anything (the screen is off in the quiet night;
//! see [`set_asleep`]), the chip goes into deep sleep, as InfiniTime puts
//! it to sleep with the screen: it stops scanning the panel, and sends no
//! interrupts for bedding to set off. Only a reset (P0.10) wakes it, which
//! then needs configuring again, as at boot. A touch in progress then is
//! dropped, bar a long press's release, which goes then rather than at a
//! lift that will never be seen (see [`crate::gesture::Tracking::lost`]).
//! The screen, and so the chip, stays on for a long press begun on the
//! awake screen until its release, but only up to [`HOLD_LIMIT`] (see
//! [`crate::gesture::screen_timeout`]): a sleeve or bedding resting on
//! it mustn't keep it lit all night. Past that, in the quiet night, the
//! screen goes off, the chip to sleep, and the release goes then.
