//! Hooks for looking at and driving the UI from a computer, over the debug
//! probe (SWD): `scripts/screenshot.py` reads the canvas and turns it into
//! a PNG, and `scripts/screenshot.py --input …` injects taps, swipes, and
//! button presses. Together they let screens be checked without anyone
//! looking at (or touching) the watch.
//!
//! Both work through exported statics at fixed symbol names, which the
//! script finds in the ELF. They're inert without a probe.
//!
//! Injected input is only built with the `debug-input` feature, which dev
//! kits turn on (`cargo run --release --features debug-input`, or
//! `compare`, which implies it): a sealed watch has no probe to write it,
//! so releases would carry its ~2.3 KB of code and test strings, ~150 B
//! of RAM, and [`input_task`]'s poll (ten wake-ups of a few µs a second),
//! for nothing. Screenshots are always there: they cost a pointer.
