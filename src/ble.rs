//! Bluetooth LE: a Nordic UART service speaking Gadgetbridge's Bangle.js
//! protocol (see [`crate::gb`] for the protocol itself).
//!
//! Gadgetbridge recognises a Bangle.js by its advertised name alone (see
//! [`NAME`]), then subscribes to the UART's TX characteristic and writes
//! lines to its RX characteristic. Everything else (time, notifications,
//! GPS, activity) travels as text over that pair.
//!
//! Pairing is required: every service but GAP needs a link encrypted with a
//! bond made with the passkey (LE Secure Connections, the passkey shown on
//! the watch), and the watch asks each client for that as it connects (an
//! SMP Security Request). A bonded phone then encrypts at once; a new one
//! pairs (Android prompts for the passkey, and gives up after 30 s). Bonds
//! are kept in flash so the phone needn't pair again. A client that stays
//! unencrypted, over a link that's alive rather than dying, gets a banner
//! on the watch pointing at the README's FAQ (see `not_paired`; at most
//! every few minutes), and is disconnected once it can no longer pair, so
//! it doesn't hold a connection slot (see [`crate::unpaired`]).
//!
//! Pairing is also what an attacker in range would go for, so: a pairing
//! that didn't use the passkey ("just works") leaves no bond behind; one
//! that fails puts back any bond it displaced; and after each failure the
//! next pairing waits longer (see [`pairing_backoff`]).
//!
//! The stack is Nordic's SoftDevice Controller (link layer, a binary blob
//! wrapped by `nrf-sdc`) under TrouBLE (host, in Rust), with Nordic's MPSL
//! scheduling the radio. MPSL owns RTC0, TIMER0, the RADIO, TEMP, some PPI
//! channels, and interrupt priority 0; see `main` for the setup.
//!
//! Besides serving the phone, the watch now and then listens for nearby
//! room sensors' advertisements, Aranet4 air monitors' and BTHome
//! thermometers' (see [`scan`], [`crate::aranet`] and
//! [`crate::bthome_sensor`] for what they say, and when to listen). That takes the
//! controller's multirole library (peripheral and scanner) rather than the
//! peripheral-only one.
