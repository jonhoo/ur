//! Screens, navigation, and screen power.
//!
//! The UI is immediate-mode: [`App::render`] paints the current screen onto
//! the canvas from scratch, and the canvas works out what actually changed.
//! All state that affects what's shown lives in [`App`] or in the [`Status`]
//! snapshot passed to `render`. What's on screen is this module's; how
//! it looks is the chosen colour scheme's theme's (see [`crate::themes`]),
//! which draws every screen, as the screens below describe them in the
//! watch's own theme, retro.
//!
//! The screens sit around the clock face, in a line on each side, nearest
//! first (see [`crate::nav`] for how swipes move along them):
//!
//! - Left, the past: Today (steps, and the heart rate, by the hour), then
//!   Last night (sleep).
//! - Right, what's next: Alarms, then the phone's alarms, once it has sent
//!   some; then the settings, the look's ("LOOK") and the button grid's
//!   ("BUTTON GRID"), and Info.
//! - Above: the last [`HISTORY`] notifications, newest nearest, one a page,
//!   with when each arrived (see [`crate::arrival`]).
//! - Below: the button grid (see [`buttons`]), if it's on; Music, while
//!   the phone has media; Air, while a nearby room sensor (an Aranet4 or a
//!   BTHome thermometer) has been heard within the hour (see
//!   [`crate::aranet`]). Possibly none of them.
//!
//! Screens away from the clock show a short bar, a handle, in the middle of
//! each edge a swipe leads somewhere from: the one facing the clock (home),
//! and the far one if the line goes on. On the clock, an accent-coloured
//! handle on the top edge means notifications came in that haven't been
//! seen (see [`Notifications::unseen`]).
//!
//! Navigation:
//!
//! - Swipe: the content follows the finger, so swiping left brings in
//!   the screen to the right. Along a line, the same swipe goes further
//!   out and the opposite one comes back; there's no wrapping round, and
//!   no sideways step into another line. The transition sweeps the way
//!   the content moves.
//! - Button: back to the clock, sweeping towards it; on the clock, turn the
//!   screen off. While a call rings: silence it. In the quiet night, a
//!   double press (two within [`DOUBLE_PRESS`]) ends it (see below).
//! - On the clock, while a phone is connected, the media gestures of the
//!   screen off and a glance (see below): a double tap (the second tap
//!   starting within [`wake::DOUBLE_TAP_MS`] of the first's lift) plays
//!   or pauses, and a tap, then a hold (a tap-and-hold, its hold starting
//!   as soon after the tap; see [`wake::after`]), is the next track. A
//!   slower second tap does nothing, nor does a long press on its own.
//!   Both anywhere, bar the hold for
//!   [`wake::CENTRE_AFTER_TOUCH_WAKE_MS`] after a touch woke the screen,
//!   when it must be in the middle ([`wake::centred`]). Each buzzes, and
//!   shows what it did for a moment where a note shows while media plays,
//!   at the status bar's left end. The phone needn't have said it has
//!   media (see `App::media`). Without a phone, neither does anything. A
//!   long press acts (and buzzes) once the finger has been down long
//!   enough, before it lifts (see [`crate::touch`]); that goes for every
//!   long press.
//! - Long press elsewhere: on the alarms screen, switch an alarm on or off;
//!   on the info screen, offer storage mode (see [`crate::system_off`]),
//!   which a tap then confirms, and anything else cancels. Elsewhere,
//!   nothing.
//! - On the settings screens, tap a row for its next value. On the
//!   look's: the theme ("THEME": the next colour scheme, of every theme
//!   built in, for the side of the day showing, night after sunset, day
//!   after sunrise; each side remembers its own), which side's schemes
//!   show ("FORCE": NONE for the sun's, or DAY or NIGHT whatever the sun
//!   says; only the theme's side: the brightness and the rest still go by
//!   the sun), and the brightness ("LIGHT", auto or
//!   soft; see [`crate::brightness`]). On the button grid's: where its
//!   presses go ("BUTTONS": off, "BTHOME", "VIA APP" for Gadgetbridge on
//!   the phone, or "BOTH"), its layout ("GRID": six buttons, or two
//!   layers; over BTHome, the latter shows "*B04", a caveat: FAQ B04
//!   explains the events it sends then), and, on the last row ("BTHOME
//!   KEY", there only while presses go over BTHome), the key Home
//!   Assistant needs for them (see [`crate::bthome`]): a QR code to scan,
//!   then, at a tap, as text with the watch's address. Another tap, or
//!   anything else, closes it. THEME and FORCE are always there, so no
//!   row moves: with one scheme for the side showing, THEME can't change,
//!   nor FORCE with schemes of one side only in the build, and a tap on
//!   either shows a banner with the FAQ entry that says why ("ONLY ONE
//!   THEME", D01; "NO DAY THEMES" or "NO NIGHT THEMES", D02).
//! - On the button grid, taps and holds are the grid's (see [`buttons`]
//!   for how they become presses). While a press waits to see whether
//!   more follows, its buttons stay lit; once sent, the last one shows the
//!   code, in the "good" colour (or "bad", if the phone was all it could
//!   go to, and it wasn't connected, or it couldn't go to Home Assistant,
//!   which a banner adds, "SEE FAQ B05"), with a buzz. A hold held on
//!   is a long press too, shown and buzzed the same, as "LONG"; between
//!   and after what it sends, the held button shows pressed, until the
//!   finger lifts. A swipe,
//!   or the button, cancels what's waiting.
//! - Screens that take over (the alarm editor, a ringing alarm, a call,
//!   "find my watch", pairing, an update, the storage prompt) get every
//!   touch: swipes there don't navigate.
//! - While the screen is off, a button press, a deliberate tap (see
//!   [`wake::deliberate`]), or a retry (a second tap, however light,
//!   starting too late for a double tap, but within
//!   [`wake::RETRY_TAP_MS`] of the first's lift: the wearer tapping
//!   again, having seen the first do nothing): wake to the clock. So does
//!   a double tap without a phone. Other touches don't, so a brush of a
//!   sleeve doesn't light the screen. (The waking input is *only* a
//!   wake-up; it isn't also acted on.) While a phone is connected,
//!   outside the quiet night, media gestures work without waking the
//!   screen: a double tap (its second tap starting within
//!   [`wake::DOUBLE_TAP_MS`] of the first's lift) plays or pauses, and a
//!   tap, then a hold in the middle (see [`wake::second`]), is the next
//!   track. A long press on its own does nothing. Each buzzes, and that's
//!   all: the screen stays dark. A deliberate tap still wakes the screen
//!   at once, so only a gesture whose first tap is light stays dark;
//!   after a deliberate one, the second touch does the same on the clock
//!   face it woke to. See [`crate::wake`] for the guards against brushes,
//!   and the field logs behind the two windows.
//! - Setting the watch on its charger (see [`crate::battery::PlugIn`]):
//!   wake, as the button does, so the wearer sees the watch charges; from
//!   a glance too. A screen already on only stays on as long again,
//!   whatever has it (see [`App::on_charger`]).
//! - On the charger, whatever wakes the screen (setting it there, the
//!   button, a tap, from off or a glance) wakes it to the charge screen:
//!   the charge glance's charge and time to full, lit as usual. The next
//!   press or touch goes on to the clock face, and does nothing else (see
//!   [`App::woke_on_charger`]).
//! - The charge finishing there, having charged the watch (see
//!   [`crate::battery::FullCharge`]): two taps of the motor, and the
//!   theme's full charge screen, lit as usual, for [`BANNER_TIME`]; the
//!   button or a touch ends it sooner, to the screen beneath, and lifting
//!   the watch off ends it too. It waits for an alarm, a call, "find my
//!   watch", pairing, an update, or the editor to end (see
//!   [`App::on_charged`]).
//! - No input for [`SCREEN_TIMEOUT`] (longer on the music screen, for a
//!   long title to scroll by; never while a banner shows, or Home
//!   Assistant's key): turn the screen off. A long press held on (a
//!   grid hold dimming a light) is input until its finger lifts, up to
//!   [`crate::gesture::HOLD_LIMIT`]; not one that woke the screen.
//! - Turning the wrist to look (see [`crate::glance`]) while the screen is
//!   off: a glance, just the time in white on black at a low backlight, for
//!   [`GLANCE_TIME`]. While the phone navigates, the next turn instead,
//!   with the time smaller above it. On the charger, the charge and the
//!   time to full, with the time smaller above them; and one shows by
//!   itself every few minutes there, until full, outside the quiet night,
//!   for [`CHARGE_GLANCE_TIME`] (see [`crate::battery::ChargeGlances`]).
//!   A tap or press during it (one is enough: the wearer is looking)
//!   wakes the screen properly. While a
//!   phone is connected, outside the quiet night, the screen off's media
//!   gestures work during a glance too, and the glance stays (with what it
//!   did in a corner, for a moment): a double tap plays or pauses, and a
//!   tap, then a hold in the middle, is the next track. That takes a first
//!   tap away from the edge, and not a heavy one: a tap held at least
//!   [`wake::GLANCE_WAKE_TAP_MS`] wakes the screen at once, and the second
//!   touch does the same on the clock face it woke to. A deliberate tap
//!   short of that (see [`wake::deliberate`]) wakes the screen too, but
//!   only once no second touch can follow it ([`wake::DOUBLE_TAP_MS`] on,
//!   or once a finger put down by then lifts), so its pair leaves the
//!   glance be. A lighter tap, or a long press, on its own does nothing;
//!   a retry after a lighter tap (as from off) wakes the screen at once.
//!
//! Alarms (see [`crate::alarm`] for when they ring):
//!
//! - On the alarms screen, tap a row (smart wake, alarm, timer) to edit it;
//!   long-press to switch it on or off (or start/stop the timer).
//! - In the editor: swipe up/down on the left half for hours, the right
//!   half for minutes; tap the bottom left to switch it on/off, the bottom
//!   right for the next page or done. The button also means done, as
//!   does the screen going off: each change takes effect, and is saved,
//!   as it's made, so there's nothing to keep or throw away.
//! - The phone's alarms (see [`alarm::Phone`]) have a screen of their own,
//!   read-only: they're set in Gadgetbridge.
//! - Ringing takes over the screen: tap to snooze, button to stop. Alarms
//!   start buzzing gently and build up (see [`Pattern::ALARM`]), with the
//!   backlight low and brightening over a minute; timers buzz at full
//!   strength straight away.
//!
//! From the phone:
//!
//! - Notifications: a banner over the bottom of the screen (the app, then
//!   who it's from) for [`BANNER_TIME`] and a short buzz. If the screen was
//!   off, the notification gets the whole (dim) screen instead, like a
//!   glance, as a history page shows it (see [`Theme::notification`]), and the
//!   screen sleeps again after. Either way, it's kept in
//!   the history above the clock; one arriving while that's showing goes
//!   straight to its first page instead of a banner.
//! - Calls: take over the screen, ringing, until the phone says the call is
//!   over (answered, rejected, ended) or the user acts.
//! - "Find my watch" (Gadgetbridge's "Find lost device"): takes over the
//!   screen ("HERE", with rings spreading round it) and buzzes as hard as
//!   the motor can ([`Pattern::FIND`]), until the button or any touch
//!   (whoever did has found it), the phone's "Found it!", or [`MAX_FIND`].
//!   Under a call or a ringing alarm, it waits its turn: the watch rings
//!   already. Whatever stops a call, an alarm, or this leaves the motor to
//!   what still rings beneath it (see `App::buzz_for_screen`), and a
//!   notification doesn't buzz over any of them.
//! - Media info: enables the music screen.
//! - Directions, while the phone navigates (see [`crate::route`]): only on
//!   a glance. As a turn comes near, a double tap, and with the screen off
//!   a glance at it.
//!
//! The quiet night (see [`sleep::Night`] for when it starts and ends: from
//! falling asleep until the morning's first alarm, or [`sleep::QUIET_AWAKE`]
//! minutes awake):
//!
//! - Notifications neither buzz nor light the screen. The last one waits
//!   as a banner for the next time the screen is properly on (and all of
//!   them in the history).
//! - Touches don't wake the screen (pillows and bedding tap it); the button
//!   still does, and so does turning the wrist, bar while sleep tracking
//!   says the wearer is asleep (see `activity::motion_task`), and setting
//!   the watch on its charger (dimly, without a buzz, as the button).
//!   Once it's on, touches work as usual.
//! - The charge finishing neither buzzes nor lights the screen: its
//!   screen waits for the first proper wake after the night, and shows
//!   then without the buzz (see [`App::on_charged`]).
//! - A double press of the button ends it: the first press wakes the
//!   screen (dimly) as usual, and the second, rather than turning it off
//!   again, brightens it.
//! - Everything shows in the dim look (white, and red for what comes
//!   second, on black, in retro; see [`crate::themes`]), at the glance's low
//!   backlight.
//! - With the screen off, the touch controller sleeps (see
//!   [`crate::touch::set_asleep`]).
//! - Alarms (which end the night), timers, "find my watch", and calls still
//!   ring and buzz.
//!
//! The quiet night yields to the wearer using the watch, for as long as
//! they do, and only to that: the screen woken (by the button, or a
//! glance) and touched. What moves a sleeper (turning over, bedding on the
//! screen) mustn't count, which is the point of the night; and once the
//! wearer stops, it's as quiet as before. What it does, and whether it
//! yields:
//!
//! | The quiet night | While the wearer uses the screen | Why |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | Screen off [`SCREEN_TIMEOUT`] after the last input | Yields: a long press held on is input until it lifts (up to [`crate::gesture::HOLD_LIMIT`], a minute), so a grid hold's release comes at the lift. The same by day | It's input that lasts; the screen going off put the touch controller to sleep, ending the hold 10 s in |
//! | The touch controller sleeps | Yields: only while the screen is off | A touch with the screen off is as likely bedding |
//! | Touches don't wake the screen, nor do the media gestures with it off | Kept | As above; the button wakes it. A touch that woke it from a glance doesn't hold it on either |
//! | No glances while asleep (as sleep tracking says) | Kept | That's turning over in bed; and the screen's on anyway |
//! | The dim look, at the low backlight | Kept | Eyes adapted to the dark, and maybe someone asleep alongside; a double press of the button ends the night for the full look |
//! | Notifications don't buzz or light the screen | Yields already: one waiting shows as a banner while the screen is on. Still no buzz | The banner is seen; the buzz would only wake someone alongside |
//! | No room sensor scans in the background | Yields already: the clock face, or the Air screen, scans (see [`aranet::Nearby::due`]) | |
//! | Media gestures | Yields already: the awake clock face's work as by day | |
//! | Navigation's turns don't buzz or glance | Kept | No one navigates in bed; up and walking, the night soon ends |
//! | The full charge's screen waits, silent | Kept: it shows once the night is over, on a screen the wearer woke | Even dim, it would light the room; asleep, no one would see it |
//! | Sleep tracking, and when the night ends | Kept: using the watch only counts through the wrist's movement | See [`sleep::Night`] on [`sleep::QUIET_AWAKE`] |
