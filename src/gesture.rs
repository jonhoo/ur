//! Telling taps, long presses, and swipes apart, from where a touch
//! started, where it went, and how long it lasted.
//!
//! [`crate::touch`] feeds [`Tracking`] the touch controller's reports; this
//! decides what the touch was. It's apart from the driver so the
//! simulator (`sim/`) can run the same recognition on a mouse.
//!
//! A touch further than [`SWIPE_DISTANCE`] from where it started is a
//! swipe, named for the way the finger moved. A long press is reported
//! the moment the finger has been down for [`LONG_PRESS`] without moving,
//! while it's still down, so whatever it does (and its buzz) comes then,
//! and the wearer knows when to let go rather than guessing. That touch
//! is then spent: moving the finger does nothing more, and lifting it is
//! only a [`Gesture::Release`], for what lasts while the finger stays
//! down (the button grid's holds; everything else ignores it). Every
//! long press gets its release, even one only seen at the lift, or a
//! touch cut short (see [`Tracking::lifted`] and [`Tracking::lost`]).
//! While it's held, the screen stays on, up to [`HOLD_LIMIT`] (see
//! [`screen_timeout`]). A
//! finger that moves past the tap tolerance before then is on its way to
//! a swipe, and the long press is off for that touch, even if it comes
//! back. Anything else is a tap.
//!
//! A lift isn't always the end of the touch: the touch controller
//! sometimes reports a finger held still as lifted, and pressed again
//! ~10 ms later at the same spot (see [`REJOIN_WINDOW`]). So a lift only
//! ends the touch once [`REJOIN_WINDOW`] has passed without the finger
//! coming back near where it lifted ([`REJOIN_DISTANCE`]); if it does,
//! the touch goes on as if it had never lifted (see [`Tracking::lift`]).
//!
//! Hardware-free, so it runs in host tests (`host-tests/gesture`).
