//! When to measure the heart rate in the background: an interval that
//! adapts to what the wearer is doing, within an hourly LED budget.
//!
//! [`crate::heart`] measures in sessions of ~13–30 s of LED, each costing
//! ~2.7 mA while it runs. At rest, the reading barely changes from one
//! session to the next (a night's field log matched a Garmin to a median
//! 1 BPM at a reading every 10 minutes), so measuring often buys nothing.
//! What's worth catching is *change*: activity starting, or the heart rate
//! still up after it. Hence:
//!
//! - **At rest the interval backs off**, doubling after each ordinary
//!   reading from [`MIN_INTERVAL`] up to [`MAX_INTERVAL`].
//! - **Movement resets it** to [`MIN_INTERVAL`]: steps, or vigorous
//!   movement, in at least [`MOVED_POLLS`] of the accelerometer's 2-second
//!   polls since the last session, may mean activity is starting. (The
//!   session itself waits a while for the wrist to be still, which `heart`
//!   checks: a moving wrist rarely gives a reading. So in practice this
//!   means "at the first calm moment after the movement, but no sooner
//!   than [`MIN_INTERVAL`] after the last session, and no later than
//!   [`CALM_WAIT`] after that".) Asleep, movement is turning over, not
//!   activity, and doesn't count.
//! - **Asleep, it stays at [`ASLEEP_INTERVAL`]** (5 minutes): sleep
//!   staging reads REM from the heart rate rising a few beats over the
//!   night's baseline, and deep from it staying flat, which a reading every
//!   20 minutes can't see. (Simulated on 60 of a Garmin's nights,
//!   agreement with its stages fell from ~64% at a reading every 5 minutes
//!   to ~59% at 20.)
//! - **An elevated reading keeps it short** ([`ELEVATED_INTERVAL`]): at
//!   least [`ELEVATED_BY`] over the wearer's resting heart rate, learnt
//!   from earlier readings (separately asleep and awake; see
//!   [`Schedule::resting`]).
//! - **A session without a reading backs off on its own**
//!   ([`FAILED_INTERVAL`] doubling to [`MAX_FAILED_INTERVAL`]), which
//!   movement doesn't undo: the usual causes (a fidgety wrist, the watch
//!   on a desk) would otherwise retry every few minutes all day. Only a
//!   watch that was *off* the wrist and then moved retries sooner: it was
//!   likely picked up to be put on. A session that failed on a *calm*
//!   wrist backs off only to [`CALM_RETRY_INTERVAL`]: stillness is when a
//!   reading is possible at all, and the signal of a still wrist comes and
//!   goes.
//! - **An LED budget** ([`LED_BUDGET`] seconds an hour, as a token bucket)
//!   caps what all of the above can spend, however the day goes.
//! - **An overdue reading spends more** ([`OVERDUE`]): half an hour
//!   without one, and the budget doubles and failures retry every
//!   [`OVERDUE_RETRY`], until the next reading. A gap in the data is worth
//!   more than the battery it takes to avoid.
//!
//! Sessions while the clock face shows aren't scheduled (someone is
//! looking, so `heart` measures right away), but their readings count as
//! measurements, and their LED time comes out of the budget.
//!
//! A few rules about the sessions themselves live here too, being as
//! hardware-free: a due background session waits up to two minutes for the
//! wrist to be calm for a few seconds ([`START_CALM_POLLS`],
//! [`CALM_WAIT`]), or not at all once a reading is overdue
//! ([`Schedule::start`]), and, if it runs out of time on a calm wrist with
//! a faint pulse, may go on brighter ([`brighter`]). Once started, it runs
//! its full length however the wrist moves (see below), unless it reads
//! first or finds no skin.
//!
//! # Trying through movement
//!
//! Until 0.10.0-rc.3, a background session stopped early for a busy
//! wrist: in its first 12 s if the wrist got restless (movement above 300)
//! before any window had passed the signal checks, to try again at the
//! next still moment (every third stop in a row counting as a failure),
//! and at 12 s if the wrist had been busy (above `heart::CALM`) at most of
//! its checks. The evidence for stopping was sound as far as it went:
//!
//! - Replaying three days of field logs against a Garmin with every
//!   signal check off, windows at 301-700 landed within 5 BPM of it 15% of
//!   the time, against 12% when paired with a Garmin reading from hours
//!   away: no pulse to be had. At 151-300 it was 38% (23% by chance), and
//!   calm, 46% (21%). 12 s stretches of a desk session read 31% of the time
//!   when calm throughout, 16% at worst 151-300, and 1% at worst 301-700.
//! - Replayed on the field logs' sessions (two nights and three desk days),
//!   stopping for a restless wrist would have lost one desk reading of 14,
//!   and two of 136 at night, and saved 12-27% of the desk sessions' LED.
//!   Giving up at 12 s cut 45 failing sessions of 129 short, saving ~860 s
//!   of LED, and lost three background readings (at a desk, from windows
//!   that only passed after 15 s of a busy wrist).
//! - Simulated on three desk days' movement, trying again at the next
//!   still moment made 0.43, 1.8 and 0.93 background readings an hour where
//!   giving up made 0.25, 1.7 and 0.76, for 10-19 s more LED an hour.
//!   Retrying failed sessions sooner instead (from 2 minutes rather than
//!   5) took 26-48 s more for 0.37, 1.6 and 0.99.
//!
//! But a desk morning on the sealed watch (2026-11-10) showed what it
//! cost: every session on a busy wrist ended after 3-19 s, and nine went
//! by in 51 minutes without a reading. The user chose readings over
//! battery ("we should be trying through movement"), and the field log
//! gains what it never had: full-length PPG under movement (its samples
//! and the wrist's movement, a second at a time, at `trace`), the data a
//! motion-tolerant estimator would be developed against. So a session now
//! runs its full `heart::SESSION_LIMIT` through movement. Accuracy doesn't
//! rest on stopping: every window still has to pass the signal checks,
//! sustained movement still vetoes it, a slow one on a busy wrist is still
//! rejected, and a reading still takes three accepted windows that agree,
//! or two in a row on a calm wrist (see `ppg::Consensus`), so a moving
//! wrist mostly just spends the LED. Asleep, a session gave up at 12 s too
//! (4 of 82 that night, on turning over), and runs on as well now: once
//! the wrist settles, the pulse is as before.
//!
//! What running on gains can only partly be replayed, as a recording ends
//! where the firmware that made it stopped. Replaying the awake sessions
//! of the field logs of 2026-11-07 to 11-10 with and without the old
//! stops: the sealed watch's 91 background sessions, recorded under them,
//! read 29 times rather than 27; the 195 older ones (whose logs don't say
//! which were background, so glances are among them), as if all had been,
//! 57 rather than 38, and of the 61 recorded to 28 s or more, 12 rather
//! than 7; the nights' 195 sessions read 183 times either way. Over all
//! the replayed sessions that's ~20% more LED. Each failure now costs a
//! whole session (30 s of LED, 72 budget seconds at 30 mA) where a stop
//! cost 3-19 s, which is why [`LED_BUDGET`] grew.
//!
//! Starting is the other half. Up to 0.10.0-rc.4 a due session waited for
//! a calm wrist however long it took, and the same afternoon on the sealed
//! watch, one waited 18 minutes through busy desk work. So a due session
//! now waits for calm for at most [`CALM_WAIT`] (two minutes), and once a
//! reading is overdue, not at all (see [`Schedule::start`]). At a desk,
//! calm comes within the two minutes 71% of the time, so most sessions
//! still start calm; walking, 31%. A session started busy can
//! still go on [`brighter`] at its end only if the wrist then calmed down
//! for most of it ([`calm_throughout`]), and [`bright_start`] is as before.
//!
//! What it costs: the schedule makes the same tries, just without the
//! wait. At its worst, a day on a wrist never calm long enough (walking,
//! or busy hands) and never reading, which until now started no session
//! at all, makes the overdue desk's six 30 s tries an hour: 180 s of LED at
//! 12.5 mA, or 432 budget seconds if its round is on the bright arm,
//! ~0.14-0.34 mAh an hour, ~2.2-5.4 mAh over 16 waking hours. Against how
//! long calm took in the field logs, a day at a desk or walking once overdue
//! makes ~1 or ~2.3 more tries an hour than it did, ~0.35-0.8 and
//! ~0.9-2.1 mAh more over 16 hours (dim to bright). (See docs/power-plan.md.)
//!
//! Time is whole seconds since boot, as `u32` (136 years). Like
//! [`crate::sleep`], this knows nothing of hardware or the clock, so it
//! runs in host tests (`host-tests/heart_schedule`).
