//! An 80×80 canvas of colour roles (see [`crate::palette`]), shown on the
//! 240×240 panel at 3×.
//!
//! The low resolution *is* the pixel-art look: every UI element is drawn on
//! this grid, so nothing can accidentally end up finer-grained than a "pixel".
//!
//! The UI redraws the whole canvas from scratch every frame (immediate-mode),
//! which keeps screen code simple. Pushing all of that to the panel would cost
//! ~115 ms per frame at 8 MHz SPI, so we keep a copy of what the panel
//! currently shows (`front`) and [`Canvas::flush`] only sends the rows that
//! differ from it. A typical clock tick touches a handful of rows.
//!
//! Living Tokyo isn't a retro theme, and draws some rows at the panel's
//! own resolution instead (see [`Canvas::fine_rect`]): those rows are
//! drawn again, a canvas row at a time, as they're sent ([`Canvas::refine`]),
//! as the panel's resolution has no room in RAM for a frame of its own.

//
// Living Tokyo isn't pixel art: it draws its scenes' detail (a noodle bar's
// noren, its stools and its steam) at the panel's own resolution, three
// times the canvas's each way. A frame of that would be 28.8 KB, which the
// nRF52832's RAM hasn't room for, beside the canvas or in place of it. So
// the rows a frame draws finely are drawn twice:
//
// - With the rest of the frame, onto the canvas, where each panel pixel at
//   the centre of a canvas pixel stands for it: the canvas then holds what
//   the panel shows at those centres, which is what `scripts/screenshot.py`
//   and the dev kit compare read, and what a transition sweeps in. The
//   rows touched are noted (`Fine::rows`).
// - After the flush has sent the rest, those rows again (`refine`): the
//   whole frame is drawn again with only eight canvas rows' panel rows
//   taking any of it (`Fine::band`), into `back`, which the flush has
//   just made a copy of `front` and so is free until it's put back from
//   it. The band's fine rows are sent if they differ from what the
//   panel shows, which is known by a hash of the band rather than a copy
//   of it: 64 bytes of RAM in all (see `Fine`).
//
// Drawing the frame again for each band with fine rows is the price: the
// canvas's own drawing is cut to the rows being drawn (see `rect` and
// `glyphs`), so a band costs little more than walking the screen's code
// and drawing its detail. And a band that changed sends its fine rows
// whole, as there's no copy to find where it changed: each a full-width
// row, a transfer of its own. Only Living Tokyo draws finely, so only
// its builds have any of this: Retro's are as they were.
//
// TODO: a hash a row, or a row's parts, so that a fine row that changed
// in a part (steam rising) is sent alone, in part, as the canvas's rows
// are: it needs RAM that the dev kit's Living Tokyo `compare` build
// hasn't got (8 bytes to spare).
