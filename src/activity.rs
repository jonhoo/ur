//! Steps and movement, from the BMA421 accelerometer.
//!
//! Two things come out of the accelerometer:
//!
//! - **Steps**, counted by the chip itself. The BMA421 has a small
//!   "feature engine" (a microcontroller programmed by a 6 KB blob Bosch
//!   publishes) that runs a step counter at very low power, so we never see
//!   the raw motion behind it. We read its running count and keep today's
//!   total. It runs Bosch's parameters for a wrist (see
//!   [`STEP_COUNTER_PARAMS`]), and counts the way their wrist algorithm
//!   does: by the arm's swing, two steps a swing, and only once four
//!   swings in a row (8 steps) have shown it's a walk, when it adds them
//!   all at once. So a walk of fewer than 8 steps, or a walk without an
//!   arm swinging (hands full, pushing a pram), counts nothing, and stop-
//!   and-go walking indoors loses much of what it does count: in the field
//!   logs, every run of counting starts with 8 to 12 steps at once, and a
//!   third of the runs stop right there.
//! - **Movement**: how much the wrist moved each minute, which is what sleep
//!   tracking runs on. The chip queues accelerometer samples in its FIFO at
//!   12.5 Hz; every few seconds we drain it and add up how far the
//!   acceleration *vector* moved between samples. Using the vector (not just
//!   its length) matters: rolling over in bed changes the direction of
//!   gravity but not its strength.
//!
//! The last sample of each poll also says which way up the watch lies,
//! which tells a desk (see [`crate::desk`]): its minutes are off the
//! wrist, so never sleep.
//!
//! Both are kept per minute for the last day ([`History`]), which is what
//! Gadgetbridge fetches as activity samples, and today's step total is
//! shown on the clock face. The history also holds each minute's heart
//! rate, recorded by [`crate::heart`], and the heart-rate measurement asks
//! [`movement`] whether the wrist is still enough to trust.
//!
//! The feature engine also watches for motion starting and stopping
//! ("any-motion" and "no-motion"), and raises its interrupt pin (INT1, on
//! P0.08) when the wrist starts moving. [`motion_task`] uses that to stop
//! polling while the wrist is still ([`still`]): the glance detector only
//! needs samples once something moves, and the heart rate's schedule can't
//! change meanwhile. (This config has no other gestures: no taps, and no
//! wrist-turn, which is why glances are recognised in [`crate::glance`].)
