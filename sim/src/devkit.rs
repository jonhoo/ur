//! Checking the simulator against a dev kit, frame for frame:
//! `ur-sim --devkit ELF SCRIPT`.
//!
//! The dev kit runs a build with the `compare` feature, which exports what
//! its UI loop does and renders with (see `src/compare.rs`). The simulator
//! follows it: it starts its UI from the dev kit's boot (the same instant,
//! the same settings from flash), replays every event the dev kit's UI got
//! (ticks and inputs), at the very instants it got
//! them, and for each `compare` in the script renders the frame the dev
//! kit last finished, with the readings it had (time, battery, sensors,
//! today's activity). Same code, same state, same readings: the frames
//! must match, pixel for pixel, and any that don't are reported.
//!
//! The script's inputs go to the dev kit the way `scripts/screenshot.py`
//! injects them, and only those it can inject. The simulator doesn't
//! decide what they do: it replays what the dev kit made of them (a
//! finger's touch, as its touch task recognised it).
//!
//! Each `compare` writes `NAME.png`: the simulator's frame, the dev kit's,
//! and where they differ (magenta), side by side.
