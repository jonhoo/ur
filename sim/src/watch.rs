//! The simulated watch: the firmware's UI loop ([`crate::ui_loop`]),
//! against a clock we control.
//!
//! On the watch, `main.rs` runs the UI loop: it wakes once a second (a
//! tick), on every input, and when its timer is due (scrolling text, the
//! button grid), has [`UiLoop::handle`] act on that, then has
//! [`UiLoop::pass`] render a frame (if the screen is on) and push what
//! changed to the panel. Here the same code runs, in the same order, but
//! time only moves when [`Watch::advance`] moves it (see [`crate::time`]):
//! a script's hour passes in milliseconds, and the same script gives the
//! same frames every time.
//!
//! What's left here is what `main.rs` has instead: deciding when the next
//! tick or timer is due (on the watch, a ticker and a timer do), and the
//! hardware the loop drives ([`Hardware`], stand-ins for `main.rs`'s), plus
//! what the simulator itself does: the finger, the motor, switching off
//! and back on, and saying what happens.
