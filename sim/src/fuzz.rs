//! Fuzzing the simulator against a dev kit: `ur-sim --fuzz ELF`.
//!
//! `--devkit` checks the simulator against a dev kit along a script someone
//! wrote. This writes the scripts: random ones, from a seed, of what a dev
//! kit can be made to do (touches, the button, waits, test notifications,
//! the battery, and, with this computer as its phone,
//! Gadgetbridge's lines, connecting and disconnecting, and a BTHome
//! thermometer), each run starting from random settings in its storage. The
//! follower (`devkit.rs`) runs each, and checks every step: the frame, what
//! the dev kit's UI got from the phone and sent it, and, now and then, what
//! it saved and boots with.
//!
//! A run that finds a difference is shrunk: cut after the step that showed
//! it, then steps taken out while it still shows (delta debugging), each
//! try a fresh run from the same storage. What's left, a script and a
//! storage image, is the repro, under `--out`, for `--devkit --storage`.
//!
//! The dev kit's storage is read first, kept as `original-storage.bin`,
//! and written back at the end. The runs start from it without its bonds
//! with anything but this computer, so the phone it's paired with stays
//! out of them.
//!
//! `--dry` writes the scripts and runs them on the simulator alone, without
//! a dev kit: a check of the generator (every line one the simulator
//! takes), not of the simulator.
//!
//! Not checked yet (TODO): the simulator's own models where the follower
//! replays the dev kit's answer instead. A finger's path (`press` …
//! `lift`) through the simulator's gesture recognition (`gesture::Tracking`)
//! against the gesture the dev kit logged; buzzes (`motor::take_request`)
//! against the dev kit's motor, which `compare` doesn't export; and the
//! button grid's BTHome adverts on the air, which this computer could scan
//! for (the presses the dev kit's UI hands its radio are checked). Nor
//! the grid's presses with both Bluetooth connections busy (BTHOME NOT
//! SENT), which takes a second central beside this computer.
