# The README's screenshots (docs/screenshots/), made in the simulator:
#
#     cd sim
#     UR_VERSION=0.9.0+$(git rev-parse --short=7 HEAD) \
#         cargo run --release -- --out ../docs/screenshots readme-screenshots.txt
#
# (UR_VERSION, for the version and build the Info screen shows; see
# build.rs.) They're also approved screenshots (see README.md here):
# `UPDATE_SHOTS=1 cargo test` updates all but info.png, which only this
# makes, as only it has a release's version. Each section sets up what
# its screenshot shows. Every name, track, and street is fictional: the
# same shared senders as the dev kit's test notifications (src/debug.rs).

# After sunset in Oslo, so the dark themes are in use: the day so far
# (steps and heart rates), last night's sleep, music playing on the
# phone, and three notifications, from yesterday, this afternoon, and
# just now. On the wrist, the watch reads close to the skin's
# temperature.
