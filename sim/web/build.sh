# Serve DIR over HTTP to use it (the page fetches the module, which
# browsers don't allow from file:// pages), e.g.
#
#     python3 -m http.server -d target/web

# `UR_FEATURES` builds it with another face or theme (see the firmware's
# Cargo.toml), say `UR_FEATURES=living-tokyo`.
#
# Needs only cargo and the wasm32-unknown-unknown target
# (`rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`): the module's interface is
# plain functions (see src/web.rs), so there's no wasm-bindgen step.
