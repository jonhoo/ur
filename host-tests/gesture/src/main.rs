//! Host tests for the firmware's `gesture` module: telling taps, long

//! Touches take time, so these run on embassy's mock clock, moved by hand.
//! It's one clock for the whole process, which the tests take turns with
//! (see `clock`): they run on threads of their own, and one moving it
//! during another's touch would lengthen that touch.
