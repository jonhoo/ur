//! Host tests for the firmware's `gb_buckets` module: the activity history
//! in 5-minute buckets, as Gadgetbridge gets it. Against a reference
//! bucket built straight from the history, and a model of Gadgetbridge's
//! Bangle.js sample store (`BangleJSSampleProvider.upsertSample`), which
//! is what the buckets are for. And its `sleep_hold` module, which holds
//! back the minutes whose sleep stages may still change: against a model
//! of the watch classifying and staging a night minute by minute (with the
//! real `sleep` and `stages`), fetched from on any schedule. `cargo test`
//! runs them.

// Used by the tests only.
